# Scheduling

[Scheduling](https://github.com/alexnavarro/Capstone-Project)  is an app for small business that needs to make an appointment to meet the customer. For example a beauty salon.

This app was made as part of Udacity Android Nanodegree course and has limited features. For now, it shows a list of beauty salons where you can choose one forsee the available professionals and their schedule. To make an appointment the user needs to log in to Google accounts.

## Install

I recommend you use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) because the development is easier thant command line. It necessary create a directory named keys in the root and put your debug and prodcution keystore. 

I'm using [Firebase Realtime Data Base](https://firebase.google.com/products/database/) and [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) and you need configure it.

For generate the apk using command line use this command: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
